== Open Rails, Blender Content Creator Notebook

== About This Document

This guide covers the use of {version} or higher for creating content for Open Rails. It is recommended to use the latest Long Term Support (LTS) release of Blender for the best compatibility with the instructions provided in this document. Please note that older versions of Blender will not be covered or supported in this guide.

=== About The Author

The individual who intially wrote this guide is not an expert in content creation and has mostly used 3DCanvas/3D Crafter for creating content for Microsoft Train Simulator from 2002 to 2016. They have also experimented with Blender, but found earlier versions difficult to use due to its cumbersome user interface. However, they found Blender 2.8 to be a vast improvement in terms of user interface and do not plan to switch to a different 3D modeling tool in the near future.

== Preface

Here is the list of things that I assume about the reader.

* You are new to Blender
* You are reasonably new to content creation for Open Rails
* You have Open Rails installed and working
* You have installed TSRE5 for Consist management
* You have a texture file editor that supports PSD, PNG and DDS formats.footnote:[A good example is the Paint.net, KRITA or GIMP all of which are free] 
* You have some idea about how {OR} and {MSTS} content is created
* You have a project in mind, but you understand that you will not create your Magnum Opus on a first try.

If you have prior experience with GMAX, Train Sim Modeler or 3D Canvas, it will be a plus, but it is not required.


=== Organization of This Document

As the title implies, this document is based on a collection of notes I made while learning to make content for {OR}.  As a result, it may not be the most organized or useful document on the subjects discussed within it but it is primarily aimed at filling a void in the available documentation set for {OR}.  This document is FREE and Open Source.  It will ultimately live on in a GITHUB repository created for it.  This means that others are welcome to fork a copy, edit it to add sections or fix errors, if desired.  I,  the author,  do not claim unrealistic ownership of the ideas and concepts contained within.  In fact, I struggle to consider myself the sole author of this manual at this point. Of course, at the moment, I am entirely responsible for its content, but I have created, gathered, reorganized and rephrased the contents as needed since it comes from many different sources. 

Due to the way this document originated, it may seem to jump around and be repetitive at times. My apologies in advance if this bothers you but if you are so inspired, you are welcome to help fixing any errors, problems or omissions.
